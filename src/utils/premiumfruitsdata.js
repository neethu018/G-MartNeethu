          "For best results, don't wash the grapes when you bring them home; instead, clean them thoroughly under cold water before consumption. Sharad Black grapes are best for out of hand snacking. Slice or add directly to green, fruit or custard salads. Use the pulp for juicing or add to other beverages for a musky flavour. Black Grapes can yield good juice. Use sliced or whole to top your ice creams, cakes, desserts, or savoury dishes. When used as an ingredient for cakes, pies, and tarts, baked grapes often work wonders. They can be used as garnishing ingredients too. Make refreshing mocktails with strawberries, peaches, pineapple, and fresh black grapes blended together. Freeze the grapes to make some flavoured ice cubes.",
        interestingFacts:
          "There are more than 8,000 varieties of Grapes worldwide. Botanically Grapes are classified as Berries. Grapes contain 80% water, hence they are a healthy snacking choice. Grapes appear in white, red, black, blue, green, purple, and golden colours. India is one of the highest Grape producing countries, while Maharashtra is the highest among Indian states.",
